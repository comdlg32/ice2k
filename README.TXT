Ice2K/XP.sys
=================================

WHAT'S THIS?
A small desktop environment for GNU/Linux that looks like Windows 2000/XP.
It doesn't have it's own window manager right now (it uses IceWM).

The source code is kinda messy. I plan on rewriting a majority in C(++).
I might have forgotten to put some things here (the source tree is all
around my home folder... I'm trying to organize it)
