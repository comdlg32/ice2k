---------------------------------------

git shortlog -e -n -w80,6,8 3.3.0...3.3.1

Bert Gijsbers <gijsbers@science.uva.nl> (30):
      Add support for nanosvg to gdk-pixbuf rendering and to cmake build.
      Set DoNotCover hint on taskbar when layer is Dock.
      Report the chosen audio interface in configure for issue #699.
      Consider that the keyboard may have been changed externally for #698.
      Free tray gradients when done.
      Fix compilation of iceclock.
      Fix tiny memory leak.
      Delete the manager on exit.
      Verify that the minimum size hints are positive, before comparing them to
        maximum.
      Increase the timeout for the dynamic menu generator to 2.0 seconds.
      Don't resize the window when a client makes small adjustments to the
        WM_NORMAL_HINTS property for issue ice-wm/icewm#115.
      Allow rolled up windows to be moved vertically for issue ice-wm/icewm#77.
      Compute the adjusted normalized dimensions on the basis of the previous
        normalized dimensions.
      Let winoption "ignorePositionHint" also ignore USPosition for issue #701.
      Adjust normalized dimensions from the outer dimensions, as this avoids
        accumulating rounding errors.
      On screen change, update taskbar location before work area, for
        ice-wm/icewm#116.
      Make updateLocation public.
      Don't reactivate a focused window when RaisOnClick is guaranteed.
      Also spy on RandR events.
      Also activate a focused rollup.
      Drop "sync" from examples, because that is now done automatically.
      Drop "shell", because no shell is used.
      When the "ignoreOverrideRedirect" winoption is set, then clear the
        override_redirect flag in the X window attributes in order to receive
        proper resize events.
      Cache 3 GCs for rendering XImages to Pixmaps to reduce memory allocations.
      Prevent a compiler warning for runProgram.
      Merge remote-tracking branch 'upstream/icewm-1-4-BRANCH' into
        icewm-1-4-BRANCH
      Check the return value of write calls in icesh to avoid warnings.
      Two pragmas to avoid two irrelevant gcc warnings.
      Merge remote-tracking branch 'upstream/icewm-1-4-BRANCH' into
        icewm-1-4-BRANCH
      Merge branch 'icewm-1-4-BRANCH'
