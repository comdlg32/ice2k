Ice2K/XP.sys
=================================

WHAT'S THIS?
A small desktop environment for GNU/Linux that looks like Windows 2000/XP.
It doesn't have it's own window manager right now (it uses IceWM).

The source code is kinda messy. I plan on rewriting a majority in C(++).
I might have forgotten to put some things here (the source tree is all
around my home folder... I'm trying to organize it)


INSTALLATION?
You should use a fresh Debian 13 installation. I have tested this with only
a fresh Debian 13 installation without any DE/WM installed.

It may work on other Debian-based distros but I haven't tested that.

Run the following:
    sudo apt-get install git ca-certificates
    git clone https://github.com/comdlg32/ice2k
    cd ice2k
    ./installer.sh
    cd ..
    startx

You can run most of the programs included from the source tree.
I'll make proper .desktop files for those soon.

I had to kind of rush this, expect bugs.

I am not responsible for any kind of damage to your computer. You should
probably not test this on your main computer for now, you can lose
data (unlikely. however you are most likely to lose dotfiles)
